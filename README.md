# Verifying Solutions for the Generic Crew Scheduling Problem from Beasley and Cao (1996) and its extensions (deadheading and layovers) from Derigs and Schäfer (2014)


This repository provides:
- text files containing optimal solutions (see the folder `optimal_solutions`) to the Generic Crew Scheduling Problem proposed by Beasley and Cao (1996) (https://doi.org/10.1016/0377-2217(95)00093-3) and its extensions (deadheading and layovers) from Derigs and Schäfer (2014) (https://doi.org/10.1057/jors.2013.20)
- a Jupyter Notebook containing code for reading instance, solutions, checking solutions and comparing objective values to those presented in Derigs and Schäfer (2014) [![jupyter-binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/gcspsolutions/gcspsolutions/main?filepath=instance_solution_handling.ipynb), [![nbviewer](https://img.shields.io/badge/view%20in-nbviewer-orange)](https://nbviewer.org/github/gcspsolutions/gcspsolutions/blob/main/instance_solution_handling.ipynb)


- an interactive dashboard that allows to quickly asses objective function values and solutions: [![voila-binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/gcspsolutions/gcspsolutions/HEAD?urlpath=voila%2Frender%2Fdisplay_interactive.ipynb)
